GROUP NAME : PROJECT GROUP 6
MEMBERS: Mehul Suresh Kumar, Subramanian Viswanathan
PROJECT NAME: MOVIE RECOMMENDATION EXPERT SYSTEM
PROJECT DESCRIPTION: 
This system recommends a movie based on inputs a user enters.

If the inputs entered arent valid the system asks the user to enter a valid input and poses the question again until a valid input is entered.

The system only asks the questions which are most applicable based on the answer to the previous question.

After enough information is obtained to sucessfully recommend a movie the expert system displays the movie that it recommends best.

To help understand we have included an example execution of the program
